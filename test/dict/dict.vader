" Test the dict()
"
" The signature dict(iter, str) is no longer supported. It complicates
" things for subclass. And it can be substituted by using map(). Here is
" the original test case:
" Execute (When a third arg is given, used as a lambda on the iter);
" AssertEqual object#dict('abc', '[toupper(v:val), v:val]'), {'A': 'a', 'B': 'b', 'C': 'c'}
" object#dict(object#map('abc',  '[toupper(v:val), v:val]'))


Execute(When no arguments given, dict() returns an empty dict);
AssertEqual object#dict(), {}


Execute(Corner case: empty iterable);
AssertEqual object#dict([]), {}


Execute (Return a copy for a single plain dictionary);
let plain = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
let dict = object#dict(plain)
AssertEqual dict, plain
Assert plain isnot# dict


Execute(Can turn a 2-list iter into a dict);
let two_list = [ ['1', 'a'], ['2', 'b'], ['3', 'c']]
let iter = object#iter(two_list)
let correct = {'1': 'a', '2': 'b', '3': 'c'}
AssertEqual correct, object#dict(iter)


Execute(Throws TypeError when the iter returns non-2-list);
let input = [
      \ 'aaa',
      \ range(10),
      \ [function('tr')],
      \]

for x in input
  AssertThrows call object#dict(g:x)
  Assert g:vader_exception =~# 'TypeError'
endfor


Execute (Throws TypeError if a:1 is not iterable, nor a plain dict or dict object);
let input = [
      \ 1,
      \ function('tr'),
      \]

for X in input
  AssertThrows call object#dict(g:X)
  Assert g:vader_exception =~# 'TypeError'
endfor
